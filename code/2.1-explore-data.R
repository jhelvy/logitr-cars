head(data)

# Variables:
# "respID"      = Identifies each survey respondent
# "qID"         = Identifies each question for each survey respondent
# "altID"       = Identifies the alternative in each unique choice observation
# "obsID"       = Identifies each unique choice observation
# "choice"      = 1 if the alternative is chosen, 0 otherwise
# "price"       = Purchase price in thousands of dollars (15, 20, 25)
# "fuelEconomy" = Fuel economy in miles per gallon of gasoline (20, 25, 30)
# "accelTime"   = 0 to 60 mph acceleration time in seconds (6, 7, 8)
# "powertrain"  = Indicates if the car is electric or gasoline

# Look at counts of values in data:
data %>% count(price)
data %>% count(fuelEconomy)
data %>% count(accelTime)
data %>% count(powertrainElectric)

# Count number of times each alternative was chosen:
data %>% count(altID, choice)

# Check if any respondents made the same choice for all questions:
data %>%
  filter(choice == 1) %>%
  count(respID, altID) %>%
  filter(n == 8)

# Visualize how many times each price level was chosen:
data %>%
  count(price, choice)

data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = as.factor(price), y = choice))

# Visualize how many times electric cars were chosen compared to gasoline cars:
data %>%
  count(powertrainElectric, choice)

data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = as.factor(powertrainElectric), y = choice))
